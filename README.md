# GPHUD
General Purpose Heads Up Display Module for SLCore

This is the open source home for the GPHUD, a (generally used for role play) general purpose HUD, mostly originating to replace and improve on the previous product RPHUD (which remains closed source and "sunset").

If you're simply looking to use GPHUD at your sim, please contact Iain Maltz in world.  For 95%+ of users this particular repository is of no interest.

This contains the sources, as a module for SLCore (also open sources), which can be used to deploy a running GPHUD server, there are basically two points for this
1) For some reason you want to run it yourself (e.g. you're not using it in Second Life)
2) You want to contribute to the source and add/improve features

Pull requests are gratefully received, bear in mind additions and features should be configurable, there should at least be some form of on/off switch (which may simply be module enablement).  KVs are very useful for this and one can be templated through annotations (see other package-info files)

A "Docs" folder will likely show up at some point
