This details deploying the code base from scratch

You can bypass this step entirely by downloading the package file attached to GPHUD.  You may also wish to "star/watch/whatever" this project to get notifications when a new release is made.

You will need
JDK version 11 or higher
Maven

Create a directory
Check out SLCore, JavaCore and GPHUD repositories
Go into the GPHUD directory
Run "mvn package"
Check the bin directory for the results
