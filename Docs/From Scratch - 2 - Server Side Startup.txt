Create a mysql database "sl" and "gphud", and import the schema SQL files from the SLCore and GPHUD repositories respectively.
Configure a user with all permissions (including create, drop table, etc, schema upgrades are part of the code) on the appropriate database for the server application

The process for starting the server is to just run the JAR file with a properties passed in.

Please see SLCore repository for an example.properties file, the file is documented but at a minimum you'll need to specify:
A listening port (port)
A host name (hostname)
A contact email address to spam you with system logs (developermail)
A database host, db name, username, password for the SL database (jdbc)
A randomly generated string to use as a secret salt (digestsalt)
A database host, db name, username and password for the GPHUD database (gphud-jdbc)
You can ignore the later secionts about JSLBotBridge and LSLR

Start the application ; "java -jar GPHUD-version-name.jar yourhost.properties"

You should be able to web browse to its port (HTTP).

Configure an apache proxy on 443 with a certificate for user access.  For reasons of an SL bug, HTTP is used for the connections from LSL.
